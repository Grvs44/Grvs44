# Elli Greaves

Hi, I'm Elli (she/her)!
I'm currently a 4th year MEng Computer Science Student at University of Southampton!
Below are some of the projects I've been working on recently.

## Projects

- [Inclusive Venues](https://github.com/Grvs44/Inclusive-Venues) (2024-25) - a Progressive Web App that allows users to rate the inclusivity and safety of venues, submitted as part of my third year dissertation
- [Budget Manager](https://github.com/Grvs44/budgetmanager) (2023-25) - a PWA for budgeting and keeping track of payments
- [ARMv1 Interpreter](https://github.com/Grvs44/ARMv1-Interpreter) (2024-25) - a Haskell project for assembling and executing ARMv1 Assembly code (in progress)
- [LiveFeed](https://github.com/Grvs44/LiveFeed) (2024-25) - a group project where we developed a cooking livestreaming platform which ran on Azure
- [SUFST Wireless Telemetry GUI](https://github.com/sufst/wireless-telemetry-gui) (2022-23) - a project I helped with in my first year of university; what I learnt during my time being part of Southampton University Formula Student Team has had a huge impact on my computer science journey (such as introducing me to TypeScript, React, and Docker) and I will forever be grateful to them
- [Film Watch Count](https://github.com/Grvs44/filmwatchcount) (2022, 2025) - a Django app for keeping track of how many times I've watched films (I've watched a lot of Star Wars!)
- [Restaurant A Level Project](https://github.com/Grvs44/Restaurant-A-level-project) (2021-22) - submitted as part of my Computer Science A Level from my early days of using Django and GitHub
- [On/Off Monitor](https://github.com/Grvs44/On-Off-Monitor) (2021-22) - my first big project, used for logging when components of our central heating and hot water systems turned on and off to identify what was causing a problem. In 2023 I redesigned it for fun as a client-server system ([onoffmonitorclient](https://github.com/Grvs44/onoffmonitordevice), [onoffmonitorserver](https://github.com/Grvs44/onoffmonitorserver))
